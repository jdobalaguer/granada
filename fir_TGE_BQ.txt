Occipital Ventral stream
  T – activated with trial/feedback
  G – more activated when gambling (because we don't know the outcome)
  B – activated when you see the bonus
  SUMMARY : Visual information

ACC
  T – only initial dip
  G – activated when gambling
  B – activated with bonus
  SUMMARY : correlates with commit to change?

Insula
  T – activated with trial/feedback
  G – more activated when gambling
  B – activated with bonus
  SUMMARY : ??

vmPFC
  T – deactivated with trial/feedback
  Q – more activated with bigger bonus



To explore:
  1– does vmPFC correlate with length of journey at the end of the frame? NO
  2– does insula correlate with risk?
  3– what correlates with outcome? 
  4– ranks?
